### Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Web Optimzation was the main focus point of this project.

The images placed on the site and throughout the different pages, really affected the speed of the site. Resizing and trying to compress the quality
of the images really helped on that aspect of site speed. Also, checking further into the javascript, there was a high indication of lag within the scrolling of the site that was to have been tracked down and altered and also a change in the size of the pizza pies through the slider that would give the user the ideal 60FPS experience that is most optimal.
